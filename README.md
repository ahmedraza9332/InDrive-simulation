### Key Classes

- **Customer**: Handles user data, booking logic, and ride history
- **Driver** (Abstract): Base class for all driver types
  - **Bike**: Bike drivers (PKR 20-40 negotiation range)
  - **Car**: Car drivers (PKR 80-150 negotiation range)  
  - **Rickshaw**: Rickshaw drivers (PKR 40-80 negotiation range)
- **Ride**: Stores individual ride information

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Algorithms Used
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Calculates shortest distances between all location pairs
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizes route planning and fare calculation
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Polymorphism for different driver types
- **STL Containers**: Vectors, lists, and unordered_maps for efficient data management

### Data Structures
- **Hash Maps**: Fast location-to-distance lookups
- **Vectors**: Dynamic driver storage
- **Linked Lists**: FIFO queue for ride history (max 5 rides)
- **File I/O**: Persistent user data storage

### Design Patterns
- **Inheritance**: Driver class hierarchy
- **Polymorphism**: Virtual negotiation methods
- **Encapsulation**: Private data members with public interfaces
- **Friend Functions**: Operator overloading for ride display

## üéØ Key Features Breakdown

### Negotiation System
- Customers set their desired price
- Drivers counter-offer based on vehicle type and base rates
- Interactive bidding with PKR 5 increment option
- Automatic acceptance if customer offer exceeds driver threshold

### Fare Calculation
```cpp
// Example fare calculation
Base Fare + (Distance √ó Rate per KM)
Bike: PKR 50 + (distance √ó PKR 15)
Car: PKR 100 + (distance √ó PKR 50)  
Rickshaw: PKR 70 + (distance √ó PKR 35)
```

### Data Persistence
- User profiles saved to individual text files
- Ride history maintained across sessions
- Automatic data directory creation
